Software Engineering: Domotics
=======================================

"The word **domotics** literally means home robotics. In Latin, the word *domus* means home. The field of domotics encompasses all phases of smart home technology, including the highly sophisticated sensors and controls that monitor and automate temperature, lighting, security systems, and many other functions." (Source: *https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-smart-house-domotics-177572*)

Our project, Domotics, allows the users to visualize information provided by sensors distributed all over the divisions in their houses. The users can keep track of the temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, luminosity, energy spent by household appliances and movement. The system stores previous data giving the users the ability to check the history of the values provided by the sensors. Users can also receive alerts for example if the CO2 values reach critical values or if they have routine and important date alarms defined.

This is the scenario that will be explored by the group G302 in the course of Software Engineering. It will be developed a project that will apply the basic principles of home automation. More information in the sections presented in the navigation bar on the left side of the page.
